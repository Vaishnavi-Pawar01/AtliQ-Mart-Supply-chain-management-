AtliQ Mart Supply chain management 
I have created supply chain management dashboard for AtliQ mart.
The key insights from the projects are:

AM Milk products are also high in on-time deliveries and delayed deliveries.

We are unable to supply the products on time and in full quantity because of lack of stock.
So, we can conclude that AM Milk products have high supply demand. 

Order lines are more for AM Butter, so we can estimate that most of the customers prefer AM Butter in their orders.

 As AM Curd has a high line fill rate, we can say AM Curd is supplied more in full quantity irrespective of delivery time (in time is not considered).
VOFR% is almost similar to all 6 products.
